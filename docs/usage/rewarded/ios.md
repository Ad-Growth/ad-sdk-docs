### How to implement on iOS platform

You need to have `unit_id` for `REWARDED` type, register on your app screen at [Apps panel](https://app-ad.adgrowth.com/mfe-apps/apps).

### IMPORTANT

This type of ad works similarly to the [InterstitialAd](/docs/category/interstitial/), however there are additional settings when registering the display block.
You can set a reward `item` name and `value`.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="swift" label="Swift" default>
    WIP
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="objective-c" label="Objective-C">
    WIP
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
