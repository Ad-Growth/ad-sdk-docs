After importing the Adgrowth Ads SDK, you are ready to implement an ad. We offer various ad formats, allowing you to choose the one that best suits your app's user experience.

### Interstitial

An interstitial ad is a type of advertisement that is displayed full-screen to users at natural transition points within an app or website. These ads typically appear between different content or app screens, such as during game levels or when navigating between articles in a news app.

These ads are known for their ability to deliver high-impact advertising messages, as they occupy the entire screen and demand user attention. However, since interstitial ads appear during natural breaks in the user experience, they should be implemented thoughtfully to avoid interrupting or frustrating users.

### Rewarded

A rewarded ad is a type of advertisement that offers users an incentive or reward in exchange for engaging with the ad content. This type of ad is commonly used in mobile games and apps.

They usually are seen as a non-intrusive way to monetize apps or games, as users have the choice to opt-in and engage with the ad voluntarily. This type of ad is often well-received by users, as they feel they are getting something of value in return for their time or actions.

### Banner

Rectangular ads that appear at the top or bottom of the device screen. Banner ads remain visible while users interact with the app and can automatically refresh after a certain period of time. If you are new to mobile advertising, this is a great starting point.

The rectangular ad format is popular due to its balanced size, which allows for effective communication of the advertising message without being too intrusive. It offers a good compromise between visibility and fitting into the natural flow of content.
