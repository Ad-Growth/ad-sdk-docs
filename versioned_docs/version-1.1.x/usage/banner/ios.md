### How to implement on iOS platform

You need to have unit_id for BANNER type, register on your app screen at [AdServer panel](https://adserver.adgrowth.com/mfe-apps/apps)

### IMPORTANT

When registering or updating your BANNER type ad in the [AdServer panel](https://adserver.adgrowth.com/mfe-apps/apps), it is possible to configure the banner `refresh rate`

### Usage

Use the AdView component to render banner advertisements in your xml view:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="swift" label="Swift" default>
    WIP
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="objective-c" label="Objective-C">
    WIP
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Next steps
