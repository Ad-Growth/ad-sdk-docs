Select an ad format
After importing the Adgrowth Ads SDK, you are ready to implement an ad. We offers various ad formats, allowing you to choose the one that best suits your app's user experience.

### Interstitial

Full-screen ads that cover the app's interface until the user closes them. They work best at natural breaks in the app's flow, such as between levels of a game or after completing a task.

### Rewarded

Ads that offer rewards to users for watching short videos. This format is commonly used for monetizing free-to-play apps.

### Banner

Rectangular ads that appear at the top or bottom of the device screen. Banner ads remain visible while users interact with the app and can automatically refresh after a certain period of time. If you are new to mobile advertising, this is a great starting point.
